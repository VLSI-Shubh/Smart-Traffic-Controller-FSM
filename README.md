# üö¶ FSM Traffic Controller ‚Äì Sensor-Based Smart Control

This project implements a **sensor-aware traffic light controller** using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** in Verilog. The design is enhanced to dynamically react to real-time traffic on **4 roads (R1‚ÄìR4)** and determine optimal green light allocation between **roads 1 & 3** and **roads 2 & 4** based on vehicle presence.

## üß† Project Overview

This FSM monitors a 4-bit `Traffic` input representing traffic density (binary flags) on four roads:
- `Traffic[0]` ‚Äì Road 1
- `Traffic[1]` ‚Äì Road 2
- `Traffic[2]` ‚Äì Road 3
- `Traffic[3]` ‚Äì Road 4

The controller groups the roads as:
- Group 1‚Äì3 (R1 and R3)
- Group 2‚Äì4 (R2 and R4)

Whenever traffic is detected on a group, it activates **Green** lights for that group, while the other group is held at **Red**. Transition between Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Red is time-controlled using internal countdown logic.

## üîÅ FSM Logic & Transitions

The traffic controller FSM operates in **five states**, reacting to live sensor inputs and sequencing through light phases using internal timers. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown:

### ‚û§ State Overview

- `s_idle`: Default state where all traffic lights are Red. The controller monitors the `Traffic` input.
- `s_13gg`: If traffic is detected on Road 1 or 3, FSM enters this state, turning Green on R1 and R3.
- `s_13yy`: Yellow phase for R1 and R3 before returning to idle.
- `s_24gg`: When traffic is detected on Roads 2 or 4 (and no traffic on Roads 1 or 3 after the s_idle state), the FSM transitions to this state, turning the green light on Roads 2 and 4.
- `s_24yy`: Yellow phase for R2 and R4 before returning to idle.

### ‚û§ Priority-Based Selection

- When `Traffic != 0000`, the FSM prioritizes:
  - Group R1 & R3 if either `Traffic[0]` or `Traffic[2]` is high
  - Else, Group R2 & R4 if either `Traffic[1]` or `Traffic[3]` is high
- If both groups have traffic, **R1/R3 are preferred** by design.

### ‚û§ Timer-Based Phase Transitions

- Green and Yellow lights are **governed by counters**.
- A signal `done` goes high when the timer hits zero, prompting state transition.
- This ensures each Green/Yellow phase is held for a precise number of cycles.

### ‚û§ FSM Transition Summary

| Current State | Condition              | Next State |
|---------------|------------------------|------------|
| `s_idle`      | `Traffic[0] or Traffic[2]` | `s_13gg`   |
| `s_idle`      | `Traffic[1] or Traffic[3]` | `s_24gg`   |
| `s_13gg`      | `done == 1`             | `s_13yy`   |
| `s_13yy`      | `done == 1`             | `s_idle`   |
| `s_24gg`      | `done == 1`             | `s_24yy`   |
| `s_24yy`      | `done == 1`             | `s_idle`   |

This FSM is designed to be scalable and deterministic, making it well-suited for adaptive traffic signal systems in smart city applications. (*Future enhancements will include pedestrian control features to improve safety and usability.*)


## ‚è±Ô∏è Timers & Control

Timers are implemented internally using a counter:

```verilog
parameter GREEN_TIME  = 16'd55;
parameter YELLOW_TIME = 16'd10;
```

Each Green/Yellow state initializes the `max_timer`, and decrements it every clock. Once it reaches zero, the `done` signal triggers the state change.

## üéØ Output Encoding

| Output Signals | Meaning                    |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| `Red[3:0]`     | Red lights for R1‚ÄìR4       |
| `Green[3:0]`   | Green lights for R1‚ÄìR4     |
| `Yellow[3:0]`  | Yellow lights for R1‚ÄìR4    |

Example:
- In `s_13gg`: R1 and R3 are Green, R2 and R4 are Red.
- In `s_24yy`: R2 and R4 are Yellow, R1 and R3 are Red.


## üñ•Ô∏è Simulation Output & Timing Behavior

The FSM was verified using a testbench and simulated using `vvp`. Below is a summary of key behaviors observed from the simulation:

### üîç Key Observations from Output Log

- **Initial State (`s_idle`)**: From 0 to 25000 ns, no traffic is detected (`T = 0000`), and all lights are Red.
- **Traffic Detected on Road 1 (`T = 1000`)**: At 25000 ns, the FSM begins evaluation and transitions to `s_24gg` (State 3), where Roads 2 & 4 receive Green lights.
- **Green Phase**: The FSM stays in `s_24gg` for 55 clock cycles, decrementing the internal timer from 55 down to 0.
- **Transition to Yellow (`s_24yy`)**: Once timer hits zero (at 595000 ns), FSM enters `s_24yy` and Yellow lights for Roads 2 & 4 are activated.
- **Cycle Completion**: After Yellow phase, FSM returns to `s_idle` and re-evaluates traffic. This dynamic continues for every new traffic input pattern.


### üìà Representative Simulation States

| Time (ns) | T (Traffic) | State | R | G | Y | Timer | Done |
|-----------|-------------|-------|---|---|---|--------|------|
| 25000     | 1000        | s_idle ‚Üí s_24gg | 0101 | 1010 | 0000 | 0 ‚Üí 55 | 0 |
| 595000    | 1000        | s_24gg ‚Üí s_24yy | 0101 | 0000 | 1010 | 0 | 1 |
| 615000    | 1000        | s_24yy ‚Üí s_idle | 1111 | 0000 | 0000 | ‚Äî | 0 |
| 625000    | 0100        | s_idle ‚Üí s_24gg | 0101 | 1010 | 0000 | 55 | 0 |
| 1195000   | 1010        | s_idle ‚Üí s_13gg | 1010 | 0101 | 0000 | 55 | 0 |

**Note:** State IDs were decoded based on FSM encoding. `s_idle = 0`, `s_13gg = 1`, `s_13yy = 2`, `s_24gg = 3`, `s_24yy = 4`.
